# Three.js setup

This is my basic setup for Three.js with, Typescript, and loading GLTF models.

## Commands

- Install the required packages `yarn install`
- Start a dev server with hot reload `yarn develop`
- Build for production with minification `yarn build`

## Offscreen canvas

Use the `offscreen` branch to run the canvas with WebGL in a seperate proces using the offscreen canvas technique.
